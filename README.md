# Calculator

This is a calculator web application developed during my web development internship at Digital Bhem. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations as well as scientific calculations.

## Features

- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus
- Scientific Functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Logarithm, Square Root, Factorial, Power, Pi, Euler's number

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage
### Basic Calculations:
Use the number buttons (0-9) and arithmetic operation buttons (+, -, ร, รท, %) for basic calculations.
Press the = button to get the result.
Use the AC button to clear the input and result.
Use the Del button to delete the last character.

### Scientific Calculations:
Click the back button to toggle the display of scientific function buttons.
Use the respective buttons for scientific calculations like sine, cosine, tangent, logarithm, square root, factorial, power, pi, and e.
